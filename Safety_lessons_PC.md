# Electrical Safety
We should follow electrical safety guidelines to prevent electrical fires or hazard, injuries and fatalities.

Some computer parts contains high voltage even if the power id being turned off. So, it is always better to examine thoroughly he printer manual for the location of high-voltage components.

Electrical devices have specific power requirements—for example, AC adapters manufactured for particular laptops.
Exchanging AC adapters with different types of devices may cause damage to both the AC adapter and the device.

Electric equipment must be grounded. If a fault causes metal parts of the equipment to become live with electrical current, the ground will provide a path of least resistance for the current to flow harmlessly away. Typically computer products connect to the ground via the power plug—large equipment such as server racks that house network devices must also be grounded.
