# 2 Laptops
## 2.1.1 Laptop Components
Laptops are portable computers. They usually run full versions of operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, MacOS or Linux.Laptops integrate a screen, keyboard, and a pointing device, such as a touchpad, in one portable device.
In order to increase portability, laptops may sacrifice some of the advantages that are offered by desktop computers. For example, laptops may not use the fastest processors available due to cooling concerns and high power consumption. Laptop memory upgrades may be limited, and some types of laptop memory are more expensive than comparable desktop memory. Laptops lack the expansion capability of desktops as well. Special-purpose expansion cards and large volume storage often cannot be installed in laptops. For example, upgrading the graphics subsystem in a laptop is likely to be impossible.

## 2.1.6 Motherboards
The compact nature of laptops requires a number of internal components to fit in a small amount of space. The size restrictions result in a variety of form factors for a number of laptop components, such as the motherboard, RAM, CPU, and storage devices. Some laptop components, such as the CPU, may be designed to use less power to ensure that the system can operate for a longer period of time when using a battery source.

Desktop motherboards have standard form factors. The standard size and shape allow motherboards from different manufacturers to fit into common desktop cases. In comparison, laptop motherboards vary by manufacturer and are proprietary.

When you repair a laptop, you must often obtain a replacement motherboard from the laptop manufacturer. The figure shows a comparison between a desktop motherboard and a laptop motherboard.

Because laptop motherboards and desktop motherboards are designed differently, components designed for a laptop generally cannot be used in a desktop. Laptop and desktop designs are compared in the table.

|Components|Desktop|Laptop|
|--------|----|----|
|Motherboard Form factor|ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX, ITX|Proprietary|
|Expansion slot|PCI, PCI-X, PCIe, miniPCI|Mini-PCI|
|RAM slot type|DIMM|SODIMM|

## 2.1.7 Internal components
Laptop internal components are designed to fit into the confined spaces of the laptop form factor.
- RAM
- CPUs
- SATA drives
- Solid-state drives

**RAM** <br>
Because of the limited amount of space within laptops, memory modules are much smaller than those used in desktops. Laptops use Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Modules (SODIMMs).

**CPUs** <br>
Laptop processors are designed to use less power and create less heat than desktop processors. As a result, laptop processors do not require cooling devices that are as large as those found in desktops. Laptop processors also use CPU throttling to modify the clock speed as needed to reduce power consumption and heat. This results in a slight decrease in performance. These specially designed processors allow laptops to operate for a longer period of time when using a battery.

Note: Refer to the laptop manual for compatible processors and for replacement instructions. 

**SATA Drives** <br>
Laptop storage devices are 1.8 in. (4.57 cm.) or 2.5 in. (6.35 cm.) in width, while desktop storage devices are typically 3.5 in. (8.9 cm.). The 1.8 in. drives are mostly found in ultraportable laptops because they are smaller, lighter, and consume less power. However, their spin rate is usually slower than that of 2.5 in. drives which have spin rates of up to 10000 RPMs.

There are several storage drive form factors and technologies used in laptops due to their compact size. SATA 2.5 is a specification of SATA hard drive with a compact casing that enclosed 2.5 in. drive platter.

**Solid-State Drives** <br>
An M.2 drive, shown in the figure, is a very small form factor of solid-state drive about the size of a stick of gum. It is very fast and designed for high performance in small, power-constrained devices. Another very fast and compact solid-state drive standard is NVMe which has read and write speeds many times faster than SATA drives.
